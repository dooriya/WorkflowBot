# Action Auto-Refreshed Pattern

Earlier if Adaptive Cards were sent in a Teams conversation, all users would see the exact same card content. With the action auto-refreshed pattern, User Specific Views of Adaptive Cards can be provided to users. In this way, the same Adaptive Card can now refresh to a User Specific Adaptive Card. A user can progress through their workflow without modifying the card for other users. 

It provides powerful scenarios like approvals, poll creator controls, ticketing, incident management, and project management cards.
